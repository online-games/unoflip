# UNO card game

# Getting Started

1. install nodejs
2. pull this repository/download as zip
3. in the root directory run
   `npm install`
4. start using
   `npm start`

# Recommendations

- VScode is a good editor
- gitkraken is a good gui git tool

# To Do

- clicking colours is a bit dicky
- show who the draw 4/2 was from
- show colour as border of wild after it has been chosen
- lock in wild after clicking as it takes too long to put down when choosing colors
- Had the isUno stay up after next deal one game. - Possibly Fixed.


# for consideration
- flash discard instead of pile
- clicking on deck to pickup can be confusing


# Things from first trial game
4. Kill player on timeout/disconnect
12. Add Game Counter. Perhaps total row at bottom of table?
15. Click wild out of turn, dont show colours.
